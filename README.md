<b>Hello, I'm Josh</b> 👋

I love building minimalistic tools and delightful web experiences.

Currently working on...

- [LoginLlama](https://loginllama.app) a tool to detect suspicious logins 🦙
- [Bucketscan](https://bucketscan.com), an antivirus platform for cloud storage (S3, R2, Azure Blob).

And some open source projects
- [Placedogs](https://place.dog) placeholder images of dogs for web development (written in Rust)
- [Gifbar](https://github.com/joshghent/gifbar) gifs in your menu bar (windows, mac, linux)
- [Todoist Box](https://github.com/joshghent/todoist-box) Todoist stats in a github gist for your profile
- [Todoist Wrapped](https://github.com/joshghent/todoist-wrapped) Unofficial Todoist wrapped you can generate yourself
