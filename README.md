<b>Hello, I'm Josh</b> 👋

I love building delightful web experiences and simple tools.

Currently working on [LoginLlama](https://loginllama.app) a tool to detect suspicious logins 🦙. And [Bucketscan](https://bucketscan.com), an antivirus platform for cloud storage (S3, R2, Azure Blob).

I am also writing on [🌍 my website/🪴 digital garden](https://joshghent.com/).

<p>Things I've been thinking about lately 🧠</p>
<ul> 
  <li> Stories connect people across language and culture </li>
  <li> 80% of software is boilerplate, we should try to remove that </li>
  <li> Simplicity is an attribute of deep understanding and wisdom </li>
  <li> Language changes the way you think </li>
  <li> Exercise and sleep are the best medicines </li>
</ul>
