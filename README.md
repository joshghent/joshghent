<b>Hello, I'm Josh</b> 👋

- [RepoWarden](https://repowarden.dev), AI-powered repository maintenance. Automated dependency updates, test generation, and custom code tasks — all delivered as clean pull requests.
- [LoginLlama](https://loginllama.app) a tool to detect suspicious logins 🦙
- [Bucketscan](https://bucketscan.com), an antivirus platform for cloud storage (S3, R2, Azure Blob).

And some open source projects
- [Placedogs](https://place.dog) placeholder images of dogs for web development (written in Rust)
- [Gifbar](https://github.com/joshghent/gifbar) gifs in your menu bar (windows, mac, linux)
